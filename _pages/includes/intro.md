My name is Jialin Wu. I graduated from the USSLAB at Zhejiang University with a master's degree in Electrical Engineering, where I worked on AI security under the guidance of Prof. Wenyuan Xu and Prof. Yanjiao Chen.

My research primarily focuses on AI security and privacy, with a specific emphasis on the security and safety of multimodal large language models (MLLMs).

I joined Ant Group in July 2025, where I continue to work on AI safety and security.
